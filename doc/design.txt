(low level)     s3fuse: layout between FUSE and DirTree
(high level)    dir_tree: stores files / directories information
(high level)    s3http_client_pool: manages s3http_clients
(transport)     s3http_client: HTTP client for file read / write operations
(transport)     s3http_connection: HTTP connection to execute various requests



readdir op:

1. fuse gets request for *readdir* operation, specifying inode, and output buffer parameters
2. fuse wrapper executes *dir_tree_fill_dir_buf* function, passing pointer to *readdir_cb* callback function
3. DirTree searches in the file hash table for the inode
4. if entry not found, *readdir_cb* is executed with *status* = FALSE
4a. fuse returns *ENOTDIR* code to the caller
5. DirTree checks if requested directory has dir_cache prepared
5a. Adjust directory cache according to output buffer parameters
5b. executes *readdir_cb* is executed with *status* = TRUE and output buffer
5c. fuse returns output buffer to caller
6.
